###Ingredients

**Welsh rarebit** is typically made with Cheddar cheese, in contrast to the Continental European fondue which classically depends on Swiss cheeses.

There is more than one way to make a rarebit:
Various recipes for Welsh rarebit include the addition of ale, mustard, ground cayenne pepper or ground paprika and Worcestershire sauce. 
The sauce may also be made by blending cheese and mustard into a BÃ©chamel sauce or Mornay sauce. 

###Origin of the names

The first recorded reference to the dish was *Welsh rabbit* in 1725, but the origin of the term is unknown.

Welsh
The word Welsh may have been adopted because it was used by the English to mean *foreign* or *inferior*. It is also possible that the dish was attributed to the Welsh because they were considered particularly fond of cheese, as evidenced by Andrew Boorde in his Fyrst Boke of the Introduction of Knowledge (1542), when he wrote "I am a Welshman, I do love cause boby, good roasted cheese." In Boorde's account, *cause boby* is the Welsh caws pobi, meaning *baked cheese*, but whether it implies a recipe like Welsh rarebit is a matter of speculation.
