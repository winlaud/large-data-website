<h3>Types of Rabbit Commonly Available</h3>

####Fryer or young rabbit
- The terms *fryer* or *young rabbit* refer to a rabbit weighing not less than 1 ½ pounds and rarely more than 3 ½ pounds, and less than 12 weeks of age.
- The flesh is tender, fine grained, and a bright pearly pink color.
- These rabbits may be cooked in much the same way as young poultry.
	
####Roaster or mature rabbit
- The terms *roaster* or *mature rabbit* refer to a mature rabbit of any weight, but usually over 4 pounds and over 8 months of age. 
- The flesh is firm and coarse grained, and the muscle fiber is slightly darker in color and less tender.
- The fat may be more creamy in color than that of a fryer or young rabbit.
- The meat of larger rabbits may be tougher so the best methods of cooking are braising or stewing.
	
####Giblets
- The liver and heart (organ meat)

####Wild rabbit
- Has a slightly more gamey taste and is therefore cooked using a few different ingredients and techniques from the farmed rabbits.

###Food Safety


####Safe Storage Times
Take rabbit home immediately from the grocer and refrigerate at or below 40 °F. Use it within 2 days or freeze at 0 ° F. If kept frozen continuously, it will be safe indefinitely; however, quality will diminish over time. It is safe to freeze rabbit in its original packaging or repackage it for freezing. For best quality, use frozen whole rabbit within a year; pieces within 9 months.
####Safe Thawing
There are three ways to safely defrost rabbit: in the refrigerator, in cold water, or in the microwave oven. Never defrost at room temperature.

####Safe Cooking
- When roasting rabbit parts, set the oven temperature no lower than 325 °F. A 2-pound, cut-up rabbit should take approximately 1 hour to cook.
- A whole, 2- to 2 1/2-pound rabbit should take about 1 to 1 1/2 hours to roast. Stuffing it will add approximately 1/2 hour to the cooking time.
- Braising rabbit (cooking it in a small amount of liquid in a covered pan on the range or in the oven) also takes about 1 hour. Rabbit can be broiled about 15 minutes on each side.
- For safety, USDA recommends cooking rabbit to an internal temperature of at least 160 °F. The use of a food thermometer is recommended to make sure that your rabbit is safe to eat.
- It is safe to cook frozen rabbit in the oven or on the range or grill without defrosting it first, although the cooking time may be about 50% longer.
- Do not cook frozen rabbit in a slow cooker; thaw first. Cut whole rabbits into smaller pieces so heat can penetrate the meat more quickly.

####Safe Handling of Leftovers
- Refrigerate leftovers within 2 hours after cooking. Use within 3 to 4 days or freeze.
- Use frozen, cooked rabbit within 4 to 6 months for best quality.
- Reheat leftovers to 165 °F.
