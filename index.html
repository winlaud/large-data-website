        <p>The domestic rabbit's diet depends on whether it is a pet, a meat or a fur rabbit.</p>
        <p>Meat and fur rabbits need food that will improve meat or fur production and large litters of healthy babies.</p>

        <p>A pet rabbit's diet should be like a wild rabbit's natural diet. Pet rabbits should eat grass hay, leafy green vegetables, and some pellets. You need to feed them a lot of fibre.</p>

        <p>A diet with too many pellets, root vegetables or sugary fruits can lead to diarrhea, obesity, bad teeth and other health problems.</p>
