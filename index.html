        <p>The domestic rabbit's diet depends upon whether it is a pet, a meat or a fur rabbit. Meat and fur rabbits are fed diets which will improve meat or fur production and allow for the safe delivery of large litters of healthy kits while minimising costs and producing faeces which meet waste regulations where appropriate.</p>

        <p>Commercial pellets are available in most countries in a variety of formulations, and are typically fed to adult rabbits in limited quantities to prevent obesity. Most pellets are based on alfalfa as a protein and fiber source, with other grains being used to complete the carbohydrate requirements. Minerals and vitamins geared toward specific requirements of rabbits are added during production. Many commercial rabbit raisers also feed grass hay, although this can represent a hygiene issue in rabbitries.</p>

        <p>In contrast, a pet rabbit's diet may require fewer calories and energy, while taking advantage of many home-prepared ingredients.Many rabbit welfare organisations and veterinarians recommended that a pet rabbit's diet should model off an approximation of a wild rabbit's natural diet as a foraging animal. An often recommended feeding strategy for pet rabbits consists of grass hay, various combinations of leafy green vegetables, and limited commercial pellets. In this case, the focus is on providing adequate fiber. Testing trials to determine if this diet meets the animal's requirements for minerals and vitamins have not been done for hay/vegetable/pellet diets in the same way that pellet diets have been researched.</p>

        <p>A diet including too many pellets, root vegetables or sugary fruits can lead to diarrhea, obesity, poor wear on molar teeth and other health problems. Studies have shown that although a short changeover period is needed, domestic rabbits are highly adaptable to diets produced from locally available forage products in developing countries.</p>
