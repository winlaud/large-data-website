 **Rabbit pie** is a game pie consisting of rabbit meat in a gravy with other ingredients (typically onions, celery and carrots) enclosed in a pastry crust. Rabbit pie is part of traditional American and English cuisine. It has recently found renewed popularity. The proverb *first catch your hare*, with a similar meaning to *don't count your chickens before they're hatched,* literally refers to the requirement to obtain a rabbit before making a rabbit pie or stew.

###Ingredients

Wild rabbit, as opposed to farmed, is most often used as it is easily and affordably obtained (and are described as more flavorful).

Along with rabbit meat, ingredients of the filling of a rabbit pie typically include onions, celery and carrots. Other ingredients may include prunes, bacon and cider. Australian recipes for rabbit pie sometimes include the food paste Vegemite as an ingredient.


###Cultural references

Two huge rabbit pies are part of traditional Easter celebrations in the village of Hallaton, Leicestershire, England.

In Beatrix Potter's children's book The Tale of Peter Rabbit, the title character's father was made into rabbit pie.

"To make a rabbit pie, first catch your rabbit"

The expression *first catch your rabbit* or *first get the rabbit* (similar in meaning to the proverb don't count your chickens before they're hatched) is used to caution against undue reliance on an event or situation that has not yet happened. It is often described as being the pragmatic first line of (possibly apocryphal) recipe for rabbit pie or rabbit stew by Isabella Beeton. The phrase has also been attributed to a recipe for rabbit pie or hare pie by Hannah Glasse. The expression is possibly much older. It has been described as an African American saying, and as a Latin proverb.
