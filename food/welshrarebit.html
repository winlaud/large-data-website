summary: **Welsh rarebit** or Welsh rabbit is a dish made with a savoury sauce of melted cheese and various other ingredients and served hot, after being poured over slices (or other pieces) of toasted bread, or the hot cheese sauce may be served in a chafing dish like a fondue, accompanied by sliced, toasted bread. The names of the dish originate from 18th-century Great Britain.

Welsh rarebit is typically made with Cheddar cheese, in contrast to the Continental European fondue which classically depends on Swiss cheeses.

Various recipes for Welsh rarebit include the addition of ale, mustard, ground cayenne pepper or ground paprika and Worcestershire sauce. The sauce may also be made by blending cheese and mustard into a Béchamel sauce or Mornay sauce. Some recipes for Welsh rarebit have become textbook savoury dishes listed by culinary authorities including Escoffier, Saulnier and others, who tend to use the form Welsh rarebit, emphasising that it is not a meat dish.

In the United States, a frozen prepared sauce sold under the Stouffer's brand name can be found in supermarkets.

Acknowledging that there is more than one way to make a rarebit, some cookbooks have included two recipes: the Boston Cooking-School Cook Book of 1896 provides one béchamel-based recipe and another with beer, Le Guide Culinaire of 1907 has one with ale and one without, and the Constance Spry Cookery Book of 1956 has one with flour and one without.

###Variants

Mrs Glasse, in her cookbook The Art of Cookery (first published in 1747 and last published in 1843), gives recipes for *Scotch rabbit*, *Welch rabbit* and two versions of *English rabbit*.

To make a Scotch rabbit, toast the bread very nicely on both sides, butter it, cut a slice of cheese about as big as the bread, toast it on both sides, and lay it on the bread.

To make a Welch rabbit, toast the bread on both sides, then toast the cheese on one side, lay it on the toast, and with a hot iron brown the other side. You may rub it over with mustard.

To make an English rabbit, toast the bread brown on both sides, lay it in a plate before the fire, pour a glass of red wine over it, and let it soak the wine up. Then cut some cheese very thin and lay it very thick over the bread, put it in a tin oven before the fire, and it will be toasted and browned presently. Serve it away hot.

Or do it thus. Toast the bread and soak it in the wine, set it before the fire, rub butter over the bottom of a plate, lay the cheese on, pour in two or three spoonfuls of white wine, cover it with another plate, set it over a chafing-dish of hot coals for two or three minutes, then stir it till it is done and well mixed. You may stir in a little mustard; when it is enough lay it on the bread, just brown it with a hot shovel.

Served with an egg on top, a Welsh rarebit is known as a buck rabbit or a golden buck.

Kentucky Hot Brown is a variant that adds turkey and bacon to the traditional rarebit recipe.

Welsh rarebit blended with tomato (or tomato soup) is known as Blushing Bunny.


###Origin of the names

The first recorded reference to the dish was *Welsh rabbit* in 1725, but the origin of the term is unknown.

Welsh
The word Welsh may have been adopted because it was used by the English to mean *foreign* or *inferior*. It is also possible that the dish was attributed to the Welsh because they were considered particularly fond of cheese, as evidenced by Andrew Boorde in his Fyrst Boke of the Introduction of Knowledge (1542), when he wrote "I am a Welshman, I do love cause boby, good roasted cheese." In Boorde's account, *cause boby* is the Welsh caws pobi, meaning *baked cheese*, but whether it implies a recipe like Welsh rarebit is a matter of speculation. 

###Rarebit
The word rarebit is a corruption of rabbit, *Welsh rabbit* being first recorded in 1725 and the variant *Welsh rarebit* being first recorded in 1785 by Francis Grose. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, *Welsh rarebit* is an "etymologizing alteration. There is no evidence of the independent use of rarebit".

"Eighteenth-century English cookbooks reveal that it was then considered to be a luscious supper or tavern dish, based on the fine cheddar-type cheeses and the wheat breads [...] . Surprisingly, it seems there was not only a Welsh Rabbit, but also an English Rabbit, an Irish and a Scotch Rabbit, but nary a rarebit."

Michael Quinion writes: "Welsh rabbit is basically cheese on toast (the word is not *rarebit* by the way, that's the result of false etymology; *rabbit* is here being used in the same way as *turtle* in *mock-turtle soup*, which has never been near a turtle, or *duck* in *Bombay duck*, which was actually a dried fish called bummalo)".

The entry in Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage is "Welsh rabbit, Welsh rarebit" and states: "When Francis Grose defined Welsh rabbit in A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue in 1785, he mistakenly indicated that rabbit was a corruption of rarebit. It is not certain that this erroneous idea originated with Grose...."

In his 1926 edition of the Dictionary of Modern English Usage, the grammarian H. W. Fowler states a forthright view: "Welsh Rabbit is amusing and right. Welsh Rarebit is stupid and wrong."

The word rarebit has no other use than in Welsh rabbit and *rarebit* alone has come to be used in place of the original name.
