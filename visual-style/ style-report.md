#Style1
##Pros:
	* Nice earthty colour choice
	* Pictures good indication of what will be on site
		* showcases rabbits both alive and cooked
	* Website is picture based, less reading
	* Sample UI on the right may be better in this case
	* Easy navigation
	
##Cons:
	* May not be enough contrast
		* Bad for colour blind people
		* A little bland
	* Too many pictures may confuse an older person where they may need it to be more straightforward with text

#Style2
##Pros:
	* Colour scheme very appealing / professional
		* Red makes you hungry
	* Fonts legible
	* No excessive color use in text (red and yellow would be hard on the eyes)
	* Sample Layouts simple, but not over simplified, straight to the point
	* Good hierarchy
	* Bottom grey sample UI may be more suited
	
##Cons:
	* Green dropdown too complicated

#Style3
##Pros:
	* Sample layouts nice
	* Big pictures, text underneath
	* UI nice

##Cons:
	* Colour choice is nice, but too monotonous
		* Does not suit subject
		* Too citrus colored
		* Would appeal to children, not so much the foodies
	* Title / Pullquote fonts a little medieval

#The final decision
I think style 2 would be most appropriate because it has the least the least cons and the most pros. However,I will be stealing the UI from style1 (one on the right).
	
	* Most appealing site out of the three choices
	* UI will be switched out for the simpler, better one in the first style sheet
	* Site is simple, but not overly simplified
		* Information is still there
		* Not left searching
		* More accessible for young and old users
	* Colour scheme actually appropriate
	* Font choice has good hierarchy 
	* Better contrast all around
