# Rabbit Info

Rabbits are cute furry rodents that can be found in the wild and as pets or even as food. They come in all different shapes, sizes, and colors, but, some of them make better pets than others.

Which one would suit you best?

## Purpose

I want to learn more about using GitHub and all the other programs out there for creating large scale websites. I'm also curious about the different breeds and characteristics of rabbit as well. As an added part, I will be covering dishes made with rabbit and covering a few recipies.
