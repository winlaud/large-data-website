###Diet
Flemish Giants can be fed like other rabbits, with the amount increased to match their larger size. ARBA recommendations include hay and occasional treats.

In supplementing a commercial diet, care must be taken to avoid excess protein, calories, and minerals such as salt and calcium, which in excess can cause kidney stones. Overfeeding leading to obesity is a major health concern for both commercial and pet rabbits.

The House Rabbit Society recommends 2 cups of chopped leafy vegetables per 6 pounds (3 kg) of body weight and no more than 2 tablespoons of fruit or carrots per 6 pounds of body weight daily.

###History
- Originated in Flanders
- Bred as early as the 16th century near the city of Ghent, Belgium
- Descended from a number of meat and fur breeds
- The first standards for the breed were written in 1893
- An ancestor of many rabbit breeds all over the world
- Exported from England and Belgium to America in the early 1890s to help improve the size of meat rabbits during the great *rabbit boom*.
- Started appearing at small livestock shows in 1910
