###Diet
Marsh rabbits are strictly herbivorous. Typically, they feed on leaves and bulbs of marsh plants including cattails, rushes, and grasses. They can also feed on other aquatic or marsh plants such as centella, greenbrier vine, marsh pennywort, water hyacinth, wild potato, and amaryllis.

###Cultural References
In Georgia, the marsh rabbit is known as Pontoon. In Alabama, swamp rabbits, or cane-cutters, are often mistaken for marsh rabbits. In many regions of the Eastern U.S., muskrat meat is often called by the euphemism *marsh rabbit* where it is sold in restaurants. It is often served in a stew or marinated, covered in flour, and fried.
