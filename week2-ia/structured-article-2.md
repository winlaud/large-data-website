Synopsis:
**The Rex Rabbit** is a breed of rabbit developed in France in 1919. Their unique, dense, plush, velvet-like fur, was caused by a mutation seen in wild rabbits in France in the late 19th century. The Rex mutation is recessive and causes the hair to protrude outwards from the body, instead of lying flat, and the guard hairs to be shortened to the length of the undercoat. After development of the Mini Rex, some people began to refer to the Rex rabbit as the standard Rex rabbit. The official breed name used by ARBA and BSR is the Rex rabbit.

The Rex Rabbit can be housed outdoors year-round in warmer climates as well as in cooler climates if the correct accommodations are made. It can be fed a combination of commercial rabbit pellets and timothy hay. Additionally, the Rex tends to be a hardy breed with few health issues.
