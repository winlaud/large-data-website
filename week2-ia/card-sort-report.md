## Observations

- Did the participants have any common comments?
	- Both did not understand what a Jakalope is.

- Did they struggle with certain articles or topics?
	- the question about the Jakalope came up both times.

- Did they find common groupings? Or were the groupings completely different?
	- lifespan and rabbit diseases placed into right categories.
	- groupings were somewhat different, mostly because of a language barrier.

- Were some of the groupings completely unexpected?
	- I didn't expect that the article about cooking rabbits would go under a kind of rabbit (refer to card sort 2)
	- Although the section of things that are bad for rabbits makes sense, i feel that cooking them or using them as clothing technically belongs there, but it still is useful information (refer to card sort 1)

- Were the results similar to your expectations?
	- I expected more of: uses of rabbit, what you need to know if you have them as pets, types of rabbits and  rabbits in the wild
	- I would say Marium would be the closest results I was looking for (refer to card sort 2)

- How did you feel while watching them perform the task?
	- i felt that some articles were easier to sort than others, probably because they were somewhat sub articles under a bigger section
